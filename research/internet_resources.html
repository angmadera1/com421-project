      <p>
        If you can obtain the same resource online, why request it? Some
        resources that are available online include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public domain writings</li>
        <li>Resources licensed under Creative Commons</li>
        <li>Media files such as video, audio, and images</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In general, if you can avoid making a trip to the library, you can save
        yourself time when researching
      </p>
      <h2 id="research-ir-wr">Using Web Resources for Research</h2>
      <p>
        Some web resources can help you find additional resources, such as the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en">Google Scholar</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Allows you to search for scholarly articles and view which articles
          are cited by other articles
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://books.google.com/books">Google Books</a></li>
        <li>
          Allows you to view a preview of a book, or in some cases, the entire
          book, including the references section
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science"
            >Web of Science</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>Similar to Google Scholar, but for scientific papers</li>
      </ul>

        <p>
          If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication,
          try searching for a special issue, yearbook, or edited volume on your
          topic. Collections such as these offer you a wealth of resources and
          represent a snapshot of collective scholarship on a topic, which can
          help you determine how your own topic relates to that research.

      <h2 id="research-ir-cs">Case Study: Using Web Resources</h2>
      <p>
        Near the completion of her research project, Bridgette starts to
        question some of the arguments in a central article in her paper, "The
        Rise of Technical Writing Instruction in America" by R.J. Connors
        (1982). She wants to see if other researchers have included atypical
        examples of technical writing instruction in their papers about the rise
        of Technical Communication as a discipline before World War II. Thinking
        that most articles written on this topic will have referenced Connors
        article, she types thetitle into Google Scholar. She notices that
        Connors' article has been cited 62 times. From there, she searches the
        articles that cite Connors' article for the examples she is looking for
      </p>
      <h2 id="research-ir-ti">That's it!</h2>
      <p>
        Hopefully you learned a little bit about conducting research and
        obtaining resources. Remember, if you start researching early enough,
        you are not limited to only those resources that you can find online.
        Now that you have read these suggestions for researching, please take a
        short quiz to help you retain some key points from this lesson.
