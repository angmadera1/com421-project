      <h2 id="research-rr-ra">Requesting Articles</h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for
        download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine, as
        is the case in the figure below:
      </p>

          alt="Screenshot of the EBSCO Host academic search engine highlighting the first academic article"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        Clicking on the <strong>Get Article</strong> link will direct you to a
        page like this, where you will either be able to retrieve the article
        through another web site or where you will request the article through
        your myILL account.
      </p>

        <img
          src="../assets/illustrations/research4_image2.jpg"
          alt="Screenshot of myILL student account requesting PDF for an academic article"
        />
        <figcaption>
          For this resource, the only option is to request the article through
          MyILL
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account, so
        you will need to register before you are able to request an article.
        Think of myILL as asking a friend to make a copy of an article for you,
        because that is essentially what you are doing. You will be notified by
        email when your article is ready to download, and you can log into myILL
        and view your page of delivered items. For more help requesting
        articles, see the Library FAQ and How-to Pages.

      <h2 id="research-rr-rbal">Requesting a Book From Another Library</h2>
      <p>
        When searching for a book, it is best to begin by searching the IIT
        library system. If you are unsuccessful in finding thetitle you are
        looking for, next try to locate the book in I-Share. If
        <strong>I-Share</strong> yields no results, the next step is to search
        for your book in <strong>WorldCat</strong>.
      </p>

        <h3 id="research-rr-rbal-br">Being Realistic</h3>
        <p>
          When collecting resources, don't assume that you will remember any of
          thetitles you look up or that you will be able to find them again
          using past searches. Keep a list of resources on Google Documents or
          on your flash drive.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        If you are confused when using any of the library systems, you can
        always refer back to the Library FAQ and How-to Pages which have a
        selection of tutorials explaining the step-by-step instructions for
        requesting resources.

        Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources
      </h2>
      <p>
        Bridgette receives the articles that she has requested and reads through
        them. One of the resources that Jane finds quoted often in academic
        papers is the 1923 text English for Engineers written by S. A.
        Harbarger. She decides that this is a useful resource to examine for her
        project, and makes a note of the title, author, and year in her Google
        Docs list of resources that she is compiling. After a quick search in
        I-Share, she notices that it is available at the University of Illinois
        library in Chicago; she makes a note of this as well in her list of
        resources. Although she has to work on another project, she knows that
        she can easily come back to her research notes and resume work.
